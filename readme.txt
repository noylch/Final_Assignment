Welcome to the game of hangman! Players in this traditional word-guessing game
attempt to decode a hidden word one letter at a time. 
With this fun and difficult game, you may test your vocabulary and deductive skills.

How to Play

The goal of the game is to find out the 
secret word before your efforts are all used up.

Play: Each letter in the secret word will have an underscore.
Starting off, try guessing each letter individually.
The guessed letter will be disclosed in its/their proper position(s) if it/they are a part of the hidden word.
You'll lose a try if you don't.



You only have a certain amount of attempts,
which are frequently depicted by a hangman drawing.
Be careful while making assumptions!


Winning and Losing: You win the game if you accurately predict the whole thing before exhausting all of your guesses.
When the hangman is fully drawn and you run out of chances to guess the word, you lose.
